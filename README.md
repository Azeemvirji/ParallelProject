ParallelProject

My final project for my course on Parallel Programming.
A parallel implementation of a Merge sort, sorted a list of names first by last name then by first.

This project is made entirely using the C# programming language. 
To run it on your local computer create a new C# project using Visual studio and replace your program.cs file with mine.
Add the names.txt in the same location as mine, you can alternatively use any file with a bunch of names.

The quick sort is commented out but does work.
